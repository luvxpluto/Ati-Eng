          <p>
          Throughout our academic journey at TEC, we have gained valuable experience by taking on roles that mirror real industry positions. As aspiring IT managers, we have coordinated academic projects, practiced project planning, and applied IT governance principles to ensure alignment with organizational goals. In the role of data analysts, we have worked with databases and business intelligence tools to extract insights and support decision-making. As software developers, we have designed and implemented applications that address practical needs, applying programming, testing, and agile methodologies. Additionally, we have explored UX/UI design, creating user-friendly interfaces that balance functionality with aesthetics.
          </p>
          <p>
          These experiences though early in our careers have provided us with a foundation of technical, analytical, and managerial skills that we continue to refine. By combining these perspectives, we are developing a well-rounded profile that prepares us to contribute to multidisciplinary teams and tackle challenges in technology driven environments.
